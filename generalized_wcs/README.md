Proposal for a WCS package

*wcs_api.md* contains the main class.

*coordinate_systems.md* defines the coordinate systems.

*selector.md* contains a definition of a SelectorModel (a subclass of `astropy.modeling.Model`, to be used when a WCS requires more than one transform based on a selection criteria, e.g. for IFUs.

*region_api.md* explains the role of regions in WCS.

*example.md* shows how an instrument scientist would use the API.
